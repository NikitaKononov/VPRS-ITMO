# Experiments setup:

---

Hardware 
- CPU count: 1 Ryzen 4600H

All experiments were performed on a Ryzen 4600H CPU. For a faster recognition process, it is recommended to use the GPU

# Metrics

---

* IoU - metric, which changes in the range from 0 to 1, shows how much
  the so-called coverage area coincides with two objects (reference (ground true) and current).
  Ideal value 1. Used to determine the correct detection of cars and license plates

# Prediction speed

---
- The processing time of one image, on which there are up to 5 cars,
on which license plates are visible, is approximately 5 seconds per CPU

- For real-time work, it is recommended to use the GPU
